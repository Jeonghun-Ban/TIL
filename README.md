Today I Learned
===============

I have a lot of things to learn, but unfortunately I can't learn everything at once.
So I organize what today I learned in this repo. The document on this page was written in Obsidian and distributed through [Obsidian-zola](https://github.com/ppeetteerrs/obsidian-zola).
